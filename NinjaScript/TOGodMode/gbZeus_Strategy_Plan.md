# gbZeus — native strategy to replace PredatorX (design & plan)

## Why replace PredatorX

PredatorX consumes the `GodTrades` indicator's `SignalCode` and manages orders,
but it **cannot do the one exit the methodology hinges on**: a target that
tracks the *opposite Bollinger band, re-priced every bar*. Its brackets are
tick/RR/ATR/trail only, and it does not read the indicator's `SuggestedStop/
TargetPrice` plots. The Zekey template therefore fell back to fixed-tick exits,
which the backtest showed are the losing regime (see
`GodTrades_Zekey_Evaluation.md`: -$32k @1000t; the fixed 60t target collapses
avg win $730→$283, dropping R:R 2.24→1.11).

A native NinjaScript strategy owns its exits and can implement the faithful
band-to-band target + candle-back stop directly. It also removes the
third-party dependency and makes the NT8 side trade-for-trade comparable to the
Python backtester (`strategies/god_trades.py`), which PredatorX never was.

## Architecture — keep the indicator as the single source of signal truth

```
GodTrades.cs (v16.6, unchanged)            gbZeus.cs (new)
  gap engine → SignalCode, MasterLong/    ── reads indicator plots each bar
  Short, SuggestedStopPrice,                 → owns entries, stop, dynamic
  SpiderwebWarning (public Series)             band target, session, sizing
```

- `gbZeus` instantiates the `GodTrades` indicator in `State.DataLoaded`
  (via the generated `GodTrades(...)` factory) and holds the reference. It does
  **not** re-implement gap logic — the indicator stays the one authority, so
  chart visuals and strategy decisions can never diverge.
- Signals are read from `gt.SignalCode[0]` (`±1` BG, `±2` FC) — or
  `gt.MasterLongSignal/MasterShortSignal`. Both signal types tradeable, each
  behind its own enable toggle (mirror the Python `enable_bg/enable_fc`).
- `Calculate = OnBarClose` to match the indicator and the Python engine.

### The one subtlety: the band target must be LIVE, not the frozen plot
`GodTrades.SuggestedTargetPrice` is only written on signal bars (it's the band
*at signal time*). For a target that tracks the band each bar, the strategy
computes its **own** `Bollinger(BollingerStdDev, BollingerPeriod)` with
parameters kept identical to the indicator, and reads `Upper[0]/Lower[0]` every
`OnBarUpdate`. The candle-back stop, by contrast, is static once set, so it can
be captured from `gt.SuggestedStopPrice[0]` (or `Low[0]/High[0]`) at entry.

## Execution rules (methodology-faithful)

- **Entry:** on a valid `SignalCode` while flat and in the session window,
  submit a market order (fills next bar open — same 1-bar posture PredatorX had
  with `ObjectEntryBarsAgo=1`). One position at a time; ignore opposite signals
  while in a trade.
- **Stop:** back of the signal candle ± `StopOffsetTicks`, from the indicator's
  suggested price. Set via `SetStopLoss(signalName, CalculationMode.Price,
  price, false)`; **never moved to break-even automatically**, never trailed.
  This is the deliberate opposite of the Zekey template. (The dashboard's
  manual `MOVE SL TO BE` button is the one sanctioned exception — see
  conventions below.)
- **Target:** the opposite Bollinger band, re-priced every bar via
  `SetProfitTarget(signalName, CalculationMode.Price, band)` — the signal-name
  overload updates the live order tied to that entry. Long → `Upper[0]`,
  short → `Lower[0]`. Entries therefore need **explicit signal names**
  (`EnterLong(Quantity, "gtLong")`), not the anonymous default.
- **Session:** entries gated to 10:15–15:00 ET; flatten open positions at
  window close. Gap lines still accumulate 24h (the indicator runs all session);
  only *entries* are gated — same as `god_trades.py`.
- **Spiderweb stand-aside:** skip entries while `gt.SpiderwebWarning[0] == 1`
  (the rule PredatorX left purely visual). Toggle: `SpiderwebSuppress`.
- **Sizing:** 1 NQ default (`Quantity`), the deck's instrument. Prop-firm
  guardrails (below) rather than PredatorX's 5-contract scale-out.
- **Optional — stop-hunt re-entry** (`ReenterAfterStop`, default off): if the
  original entry price prints again within `ReenterWindowBars` after a stop, and
  the candle closes back in the trade direction, re-enter with a fresh
  candle-back stop. Mirrors `god_trades.py` so parity holds.

## Config surface (mirror the Python names for 1:1 parity)

Signal (pass-through to the indicator, or duplicate to keep the strategy self-
contained): `MinimumGapSizeTicks`, `MinimumBarsBeforeValid`, `BollingerPeriod/
StdDev`, `BollingerBandProximityTicks`, `ConfirmationBarsAfterTouch`,
`ContinuationConfirmationMode`, `EnableBollingerGap`, `EnableContinuation`,
midpoint-filter percents. Execution: `Quantity`, `EntryStartTime/EntryEndTime`,
`FlattenAtWindowEnd`, `StopOffsetTicks`, `SpiderwebSuppress`, `ReenterAfterStop`,
`ReenterWindowBars`, plus an `ExitMode { BandTarget | FixedTicks }` so the fixed
regime can be A/B'd against band-to-band inside one binary. Trade management
(GreyBeard standard names, verbatim): `ManualNudgeTicks` (default 4),
`ManualBeOffsetTicks` (default 0, signed). Dashboard: `ShowDashboard` (true),
`DashboardCorner` (`GbPanelCorner`, default TopLeft), `DashboardStartMinimized`
(false). Groups are numbered (`"0. Developer"`, `"1. …"`) to force grid order.

## Prop-firm guardrails (match the user's other strategies)
Daily realized-loss lockout, optional per-trade max loss, min-hold gate, and
end-of-session flat. Surface `PropDailyLossLimit`, `PropTrailingThreshold` as
inputs. Backtest already shows 1 NQ breaches a $2k trailing floor, so these are
information/kill-switch, not a fix — sizing to the floor is a separate question.

## Validation workflow (the established Python↔NT8 parity gate)
1. Python is the reference: `strategies/god_trades.py` (band exit, session
   gated) already runs over full history.
2. Build `gbZeus`, run it in **NT8 Playback** on the same NQ 1000-tick
   dates.
3. Export executions → `tools/convert_nt8_executions.py` →
   `tools/compare_nt8.py` against the Python trades CSV (the GodZillaKilla
   precedent). Reconcile the known ~1-bar entry offset; expect matching entry
   bars, stop/target prices within a tick, and matching P&L sign per trade.
4. Only after parity: forward-test on Sim101, then evaluate live-sizing.

## GreyBeard house conventions (from `../GreyBeard-Typical-NinjaTrader.md`)

Applied by default, independent of the trading logic:

- **Namespace / file / location:** `NinjaTrader.NinjaScript.Strategies.GreyBeard`,
  file `gbZeus.cs` under `bin/Custom/Strategies/GreyBeard/`.
- **`0. Developer` group** (read-only, no `[NinjaScriptProperty]`, expression-
  bodied): `Author => "GreyBeard"`, `Version => "1.0.0"`,
  `Website => "https://greybeardconsulting.net/"`. Every `GroupName` is
  number-prefixed for deterministic grid ordering.
- **Display flags in `SetDefaults`** (this strategy has plots): 
  `IsSuspendedWhileInactive = false`, `ShowTransparentPlotsInDataBox = true`.
- **Order plumbing:** `StopTargetHandling = PerEntryExecution`; base brackets set
  once in `State.Configure` (ticks); all live stop/target moves through the
  signal-name `SetStopLoss`/`SetProfitTarget(CalculationMode.Price, …)`
  overloads; **never `SetTrailStop`** (NT8 silently ignores it once `SetStopLoss`
  is in play).

### On-chart dashboard + control panel (full suite)

A draggable, minimizable, corner-anchored WPF panel — created only in
`State.Realtime`, torn down in `State.Terminated`, never in Strategy Analyzer:

- **Info rows:** instrument/account, FLAT/LONG/SHORT, key state (session
  open?, spiderweb?, ExitMode), and while in a position Entry / Stop / Target /
  Qty / uPnL.
- **Buttons:** `AUTO ON/OFF`, `LONG ON/OFF`, `SHORT ON/OFF` (LONG/SHORT greyed
  while AUTO off), `REV`, `MOVE SL TO BE`, `SL ▼/▲`, `TP ▼/▲` (▲ always raises
  price, ▼ lowers, for both directions; SL red, TP green), `FLATTEN ALL` /
  `CLOSE ALL` (closes + pauses AUTO).
- **Manual-command pattern (critical):** Click handlers run on the WPF UI
  thread and only set flags (`volatile bool _pendingBE`,
  `Interlocked.Add(ref _pendingSlNudgeTicks, ±ManualNudgeTicks)`), never call
  order APIs. A `ProcessManualCommands()` on the strategy thread drains them
  (`Interlocked.Exchange`) and does the work — called from **`OnMarketData`**
  (tick-level) so FLATTEN/BE act immediately. BE beats a same-window SL nudge;
  validate the new price is on the correct side of market before submitting.
- Frozen `SolidColorBrush` statics via a `MakeFrozen` helper; templated buttons
  (`ControlTemplate` + `TemplateBinding`), not bare `Button`s.

### How the dashboard reconciles with "never break-even"

The methodology forbids *automatic* break-even/trailing, and the strategy honors
that — no auto-BE, no trail. But the GreyBeard suite still ships the manual
`MOVE SL TO BE` and `SL/TP` nudge buttons, which the conventions doc explicitly
calls out as *the one sanctioned place a stop may move backward*, because the
user is intentionally overriding. So: automatic behavior stays faithful; manual
discretion is available. `AUTO OFF` + the manual buttons also turn this into a
usable discretionary cockpit for trading the signals by hand.

## Provenance
- Clean-room: the strategy is original; it only *consumes* the user's own
  `GodTrades` indicator. No PredatorX code is referenced or reproduced.

## Risks / open questions
- **Entry timing parity:** next-bar-open (NT8 market) vs Python's signal-bar
  close. Decide whether to match Python exactly (limit-at-close) or accept the
  realistic 1-bar delay and align the Python run to it. Recommend the latter.
- **Band target never reached before session flat:** the faithful target is
  wide; many trades will exit at the window-close flat, not the band. That's
  the methodology's actual behavior and is already what the Python §6 numbers
  reflect — not a bug, but sets the expectation (this is a ~break-even edge).
- **Indicator-as-strategy-input warning:** referencing an overlay indicator
  that draws objects from inside a strategy is fine, but confirm no double-draw/
  performance issue in Playback; if so, run the indicator in signal-only mode
  (disable its `Draw.*` via the existing show-toggles).
- **Should the strategy re-derive signals instead of hosting the indicator?**
  Hosting keeps one source of truth (preferred); re-deriving decouples but risks
  drift. Recommend hosting.

## Phased build (when you green-light it)
1. Skeleton: GreyBeard scaffolding (namespace/folder, `0. Developer` group,
   numbered groups, display flags, `PerEntryExecution`, base brackets in
   `Configure`). Host the indicator, read `SignalCode`, signal-named market
   entry in-session, 1 contract, band target + candle stop, no BE. Compile clean.
2. Add spiderweb stand-aside, window-flat, `ExitMode` toggle, prop guardrails.
3. Dashboard + control-button suite and the `OnMarketData` manual-command
   drain (the biggest single chunk — lift the pattern from `Terminator_V2.cs` /
   `GodZillaKilla.cs` rather than reinventing it).
4. Playback + `compare_nt8.py` parity gate vs `god_trades.py` (AUTO ON,
   dashboard idle) — verify the automated path matches the research.
5. Optional stop-hunt re-entry; re-run parity. Document results in this folder.

**Scope check before coding:** the backtest says the underlying edge is
marginal. This strategy is worth building as *faithful tooling* (it makes the
NT8 side finally match the research and removes the third-party black box), but
it is not expected to convert a break-even edge into a winning one. Build it to
trade the methodology correctly and to close the Python↔NT8 loop — not on an
expectation of alpha the data doesn't support.
