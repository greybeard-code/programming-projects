## Version History

| Version | Summary |
|---|---|
| **1.7.0** | Playr build. `FlattenEverything` reentrancy guard — cross-thread double-checked lock (`_flattenLock` + `volatile _flattenInProgress`) prevents concurrent execution when `CloseBtn_Click` (WPF thread) races a data-thread flatten. Actual close sequence extracted to `FlattenEverythingInternal`. Both skip paths log under `EnableDebug`. |
| 1.6.9 | Playr build. GUI "Display" category split into Dashboard Display / Indicator Display / ATM Marker Display. Added `gbBarStatus` visual indicator (`ShowBarStatusIndicator`, default on). HUD auto-sizes width via `MeasureHudTextWidth()` — fixes confluence label clipping. `IsExitOnSessionCloseStrategy` → `true`. `UseNCSignals` default → `false`. `IsCurrentPositionForInstrument` wrapped in `lock(Account.Positions)`. Fixed-Ticks order filter narrowed to `"Stop loss"` / `"Profit target"` only. `NC_Brush` hidden correctly when `UseNCSignals = false`. Auto-arm OFF now symmetrically clears long + short + reverse. |
| 1.6.7–1.6.8 | Intermediate Playr builds (not separately committed to this repo). |
| 1.6.6 | Playr build. GodZuki v1.0.3 companion build. |
| 1.6.5 | Fixed CategoryOrder collision (Display/NobleCloud both at 12). Fixed CSV log header to match 14-column output. Fixed martingale close path to use `WriteTradeLogRecord`. Applied Defense #8 `WriteTradeLogRecord` patches to both normal ATM and martingale ATM stale-ID paths. |
| 1.6.4 | Internal bump by Playr101. |
| 1.6.3 | Added NobleCloud (NC) as sixth signal indicator. Defense #8 mid-trade staleness detection. |

## Order Management Modes

### ATM Strategy Mode
Submits a market entry order and immediately attaches a pre-configured NT8 ATM template for stop-loss, profit target, and trailing stop management. ATM templates are selected from the NT8 ATM library at configuration time.

- Entry is via `AtmStrategyCreate` at bar close (pending signal queued on bar 0, executed on bar 1 tick series)
- Supports a one-time **Martingale Recovery** entry in the opposite direction after a stop-loss, using a separate ATM template
- Optional **ATM Plot Markers** draw entry/exit lines and labels directly on the price panel

### Fixed Ticks Mode
Strategy-managed entries with configurable quantity, stop-loss ticks, and profit target ticks. Supports optional breakeven logic (move stop to entry ± offset after price moves a set distance in favor).

## Signal System

### Sub-Indicators
GodZillaKilla instantiates all six KPZ sub-indicators at `State.DataLoaded`. Each exposes a `Signal_Trade` series; the strategy reads `Signal_Trade[0]` every bar close.

An optional **gbBarStatus** indicator can also be added to the chart panel (`ShowBarStatusIndicator`, default on). It is visual-only — not read for signals, entries, exits, filters, or PnL.

### Signal Configuration
Each indicator has independent Long and Short threshold values and comparison operators (`Equal`, `GreaterOrEqual`, `GreaterThan`, `LessOrEqual`, `LessThan`, `NotEqual`).

### Trigger Sets
Two independent group trigger sets can be configured:

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| **Set 1 Required Count** | Minimum number of enabled Set 1 signals that must agree on the same bar |
| **Set 2 Required Count** | Minimum number of enabled Set 2 signals that must agree |

**Required Count behavior:** With N indicators enabled and Required Count = R, the trigger fires when at least R signals agree in the same direction (long or short). Flat signals (0) are ignored. If both long and short sides both reach R on the same bar, the conflict guard suppresses the trigger. Setting Required Count = N effectively requires all enabled signals to agree.

If both sets fire in conflicting directions on the same bar, no entry is taken.

### EMA Filter
Optional EMA filter using a short and long period. When enabled:
- Long entries require short EMA > long EMA (bullish trend)
- Short entries require short EMA < long EMA (bearish trend)

---

## Filters

### Session Time Filters
Up to three configurable trading windows (TF1, TF2, TF3) with optional flatten-at-window-end per window. An additional Skip Window suppresses entries during a configurable midday or news window.

### News Filter
Integrates with `gbNewsSignals` for real-time economic calendar blocking. Configurable pre/post block minutes, impact level toggles (High / Medium / Low), and NT8 Alert integration. Live chart only — automatically disabled in Strategy Analyzer and Market Replay.

## Risk Management

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Daily Profit Target** | Flattens all positions and disables entries when total PnL reaches the target |
| **Daily Loss Limit** | Same for loss side |
| **Use Unrealized PnL** | Includes open position PnL in the daily limit calculation |
| **Start Fresh On Enable** | Ignores historical trade PnL when the strategy is enabled in realtime |
| **Martingale On Stop Loss** | Fires one recovery trade in the opposite direction after a stop-loss event |
| **Session-Close Exit** | `IsExitOnSessionCloseStrategy = true` — NT8 auto-flattens at session end as a backstop if the strategy's own TF/daily-limit flatten paths are missed (e.g., strategy disabled mid-day, TF3 EndTime3 misaligned) |

## Defense Mechanisms

GodZillaKilla includes eight layered defenses against NT8 lifecycle edge cases:

| Defense | Trigger | Action |
|---|---|---|
| #1 | Entry order fills before ATM registration | Position adopted; ATM state corrected |
| #2 | Duplicate fill events | Second fill ignored via execution ID tracking |
| #3 | ATM ID never confirmed (registration timeout) | Stale ID cleared after 10 seconds |
| #4 | Draw object pool exhaustion | Rolling 250-bar cleanup of per-prefix draw tags |
| #5 | Naked position at strategy enable | Detects and adopts pre-existing account position |
| #6 | Position inherited from prior session | Captured as baseline; PnL calculated from delta |
| #7 | `TryGetAtmMarketPositionSafe` failure | Falls back to account-level position check |
| #8 | Mid-trade ATM ID goes stale (HDS bounce) | Writes trade log, flattens at account level, resets all ATM state |

**FlattenEverything thread safety:** All flatten paths funnel through a single `FlattenEverything(reason)` gate that uses a double-checked lock (`_flattenLock` + `volatile _flattenInProgress`) to prevent concurrent execution when the WPF-thread CLOSE ALL button races a data-thread trigger. The actual close sequence runs in `FlattenEverythingInternal`.

**Defense #8 detail:** Fires inside `EvictStaleAtmIdsIfTimedOut` on every tick. Detects a mismatch between the ATM reporting Flat and the account still holding a position. `WriteTradeLogRecord` is called **before** clearing `_atmPositionConfirmed` — both the normal ATM path and the martingale ATM path are protected. The estimated PnL from `dailyUnrealizedPnL` is used for the forced-close log record.

## Dashboard (HUD)

The SharpDX overlay panel shows:
- Strategy name and version
- Master arm status (ENABLED / DISABLED) with L / S / REV sub-status
- Session status (IN SESSION / OUT OF SESSION)
- News filter status (if enabled)
- Strategy PnL, Daily PnL, Open PnL
- Risk target and loss limit settings
- Current trade status (IDLE / IN POSITION)
- Last trade summary with PnL
- Optional signal tracking stats (per-indicator win/loss counts and confluence combo stats)

Position: configurable (`TopLeft` / `TopRight` / `BottomLeft` / `BottomRight` / `Center` / `Hidden`).
Size: `Tiny` / `Small` / `Normal` / `Large` / `Huge`.

The panel auto-sizes its width each render pass using `MeasureHudTextWidth()` (SharpDX `DirectWrite.TextLayout`). Width is the larger of `HudBoxWidth()` (preset floor) and the measured widest row, preventing clipping of long confluence labels (e.g., `SET1-G6-KO+PA+TH+SJ+SU+NC`). The panel position is then clamped to stay within the chart render area.

---

## Control Panel

An on-chart WPF button panel (ARM LONG / ARM SHORT / REV / AUTO / CLOSE) allows realtime manual control of:
- Arming long and/or short entries independently
- Toggling auto-arm — when OFF, disarms long, short, **and** reverse together (symmetric kill-switch); when ON, arms all three
- Toggling reverse-on-opposite-signal behaviour independently
- Immediately flattening all positions and cancelling orders

---

## Audio Alerts

- Individual signal alerts — fires when a single sub-indicator signal passes the filter
- Group trigger alerts — fires on a Set 1 or Set 2 confluence trigger
- Both have independent sound file selection and per-bar deduplication

---

## CSV Trade Log

When `LogEnabled = true`, a CSV file is created at `State.DataLoaded`:

**Filename:** `GodZilla_[AccountName]_YYYYMMDD_HHmmss.csv`

**Columns (14):**
`OpenTime, Account, Instrument, OpenPrice, Qty, CloseTime, Trigger, Direction, AtmStrategyName, RealizedPnL, SignalCombo, UsedSignals, TradeResult, LastTradeLine`

One row is written per closed trade. Defense #8 forced-close events also write a log row using the estimated unrealized PnL at time of detection.
