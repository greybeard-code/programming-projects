# MultiDayDownload — NinjaTrader 8 Market Replay Downloaders

Two NinjaScript AddOns that download Market Replay `.nrd` files in bulk, without using NinjaTrader's built-in one-day-at-a-time UI. Both tools appear under **Tools** in the Control Center menu.

## MultidayReplayDownloaderWindowCN.cs — Multiday Replay Downloader

A flexible downloader for any futures instrument over any date range.

### Features

- Select any futures instrument from a dropdown (or type one in)
- Instruments are pre-populated with their current active contract (handles quarterly, bi-monthly, and monthly roll schedules)
- Accepts contract notation in either numeric (`NQ 03-26`) or letter-code (`NQ H26` / `NQH26`) format — auto-normalized on Load
- Pick start/end dates manually, from a calendar popup, or with **Last 7 / 30 / 90 Days** quick-select buttons
- **Skip existing replay files** checkbox (default on) avoids re-downloading data you already have
- Sundays included; only Saturdays skipped
- Sequential downloads with live progress bar and ETA
- Cancel mid-run; summary shows Completed / Failed / Canceled counts

## Installation

1. Copy the `.cs` file(s) into your NinjaTrader 8 AddOns folder:
   `Documents\NinjaTrader 8\bin\Custom\AddOns\`
2. In NinjaTrader, open **NinjaScript Editor** and compile (F5), or restart NinjaTrader
3. The tool(s) appear under **Tools** in the Control Center

## Requirements

- NinjaTrader 8
- An active data connection that supports historical Market Replay data (e.g., Tradovate, Rithmic/Continuum)
- The connection must be logged in before clicking Download

## Notes

- Downloaded files are stored in `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\NinjaTrader 8\db\replay\<InstrumentFullName>\`
- Files are named `YYYYMMDD.nrd`
- Both tools use NinjaTrader's internal `RequestMarketReplay` API via reflection, the same mechanism the built-in downloader uses
