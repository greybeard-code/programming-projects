# KingPanaZilla — NinjaTrader 8 Indicator Suite

**Namespace:** `NinjaTrader.NinjaScript.Indicators.GreyBeard.KingPanaZilla`

A curated collection of five NinjaTrader 8 indicators unified under the GreyBeard namespace. Four core indicators were reworked from their original vendor sources into a consistent `gb`-prefixed naming convention, sharing a common visual style (toggle button, gradient zones, custom marker rendering, popup/sound/email alerts). A fifth composite indicator — `gbKingPanaZilla` — loads the three signal-emitting indicators and combines their outputs into three cross-system trade signals.

---

## Indicators

### gbKingPanaZilla — Composite Signal Indicator

A **meta-indicator** that loads `gbKingOrderBlock`, `gbPANAKanal`, and `gbThunderZilla` and cross-combines their `Signal_Trade` values into three unified trade signals. Add this single indicator to a chart to get all three child indicators' signals in one place, or reference it from a Strategy via `gbKingPanaZilla()`.

**How it works:**

The three child indicators are instantiated via their factory methods (`CacheIndicator`) in `State.DataLoaded`, placing them in NinjaTrader's `NinjaScripts` collection so their `OnBarUpdate` runs automatically each bar.

Each of the three output plots uses **+1 (buy), −1 (sell), 0 (no signal)**:

| Plot | Condition (buy) | Condition (sell) |
|---|---|---|
| `PanaZilla_Trade` | PanaKanal `Signal_Trade ≥ 2` **AND** ThunderZilla `Signal_Trade ≥ 3` | PanaKanal `≤ −2` AND ThunderZilla `≤ −3` |
| `KingZilla_Trade` | ThunderZilla `Signal_Trade ≥ 3` **AND** KingOrderBlock `Signal_Trade ≥ 1` | ThunderZilla `≤ −3` AND KingOrderBlock `≤ −1` |
| `KingPana_Trade` | PanaKanal `Signal_Trade ≥ 2` **AND** KingOrderBlock `Signal_Trade ≥ 1` | PanaKanal `≤ −2` AND KingOrderBlock `≤ −1` |

The signal thresholds capture the **highest-conviction sub-signals** from each child:
- PanaKanal ≥ 2 = Break or Pullback confirmation (not just a raw trend flip)
- ThunderZilla ≥ 3 = Pullback signal (both SolarWind + Sumo aligned with a pullback)
- KingOrderBlock ≥ 1 = any Return or Breakout signal

**Output plots:** `PanaZilla_Trade`, `KingZilla_Trade`, `KingPana_Trade`

**Child indicator signal scales (for reference):**

| Indicator | Positive value | Negative value |
|---|---|---|
| `gbPANAKanal Signal_Trade` | 1=Trend Start, 2=Break, 3=Pullback | −1/−2/−3 mirror |
| `gbThunderZilla Signal_Trade` | 1=Trend Start, 2=Slowdown, 3=Pullback, 4=Move Stop | −1/−2/−3/−4 mirror |
| `gbKingOrderBlock Signal_Trade` | 1=Return, 2=Breakout | −1/−2 mirror |

**Visual output:** `Draw.ArrowUp` / `Draw.ArrowDown` markers painted on the price panel at configurable tick offsets above/below each signal bar.

**Key parameters:** all `King_*`, `Pana_*`, and `Thunder_*` parameters mirror the child indicator defaults. Visual: `PanaZilliaBrush`, `KingZillaBrush`, `KingPanaBrush`, `ArrowOffset`

**Display parameters:** `ShowKingOrderBlock`, `ShowPANAKanal`, `ShowThunderZilla` (all default `true`) — when enabled, the corresponding child indicator's drawings (zones, channels, clouds) are rendered on the same chart panel as `gbKingPanaZilla`. Each can be toggled off independently to reduce visual clutter while retaining its signal in the combined plots.

**CSV Logging:**

Enable the **Logging → Enabled** toggle to write a signal log to the NinjaTrader user data folder (`Documents\NinjaTrader 8\`). The file is named with the activation timestamp:

```
gbKPZlog_YYYYMMDD_HHmmss.csv
```

The file is created at indicator load with a header row. One row is appended for each bar on which at least one trade signal fires:

```
DateTime,Instrument,Price,PanaZillia_Trade,KingZilla_Trade,KingPana_Trade
2026-04-26 09:31:00,"NQ 06-26",21483.50,1,1,0
2026-04-26 10:15:00,"NQ 06-26",21510.25,0,0,-1
```

| Column | Content |
|---|---|
| `DateTime` | Bar close time — `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss` |
| `Instrument` | Full contract name (quoted) |
| `Price` | Close price formatted to instrument tick precision |
| `PanaZillia_Trade` | −1 / 0 / 1 |
| `KingZilla_Trade` | −1 / 0 / 1 |
| `KingPana_Trade` | −1 / 0 / 1 |

The writer is flushed after every row and closed cleanly when the indicator is removed or the chart is closed. Logging is **off by default**.

### gbKingOrderBlock — King Order Block

Identifies **Order Blocks** (institutional supply and demand zones) using Structure Break analysis.

**How it works:**

1. **Swing Point Detection** — scans for swing highs and lows using a configurable *neighborhood* period. Three detection algorithms handle flat-top/bottom plateaus and mixed-width structures.
2. **BOS / CHoCH Classification** — when price breaks a swing, the indicator classifies it as either a *Break of Structure* (BOS, trend continuation) or *Change of Character* (CHoCH, potential reversal) based on the sequence of prior breaks.
3. **Imbalance (Fair Value Gap) Detection** — looks for consecutive marubozu candles in the same direction to mark imbalanced price zones.
4. **Order Block Formation** — an Order Block is confirmed when a swing point is paired with a nearby imbalance and a BOS/CHoCH in the opposite direction, within a configurable look-back period.
5. **Signals** — two signal types are emitted:
   - **Return** — price wicks back into an active Order Block zone (entry signal).
   - **Breakout** — price closes through the invalidation level of an Order Block.
6. **Zone Rendering** — active and inactive Order Blocks and Imbalances are drawn as gradient-shaded rectangles. BOS/CHoCH levels are drawn as dashed lines with optional text labels. Swing points are rendered as filled ellipses.

**Output plots:** `Signal_Trade`, `Signal_State`, `Signal_Zone_Bullish`, `Signal_Zone_Bearish`

**Key parameters:** `SwingPointNeighborhood`, `ImbalanceQualifying`, `OrderBlockFindingBosChochPeriod`, `OrderBlockAge`, `OrderBlocksSameDirectionOffset`, `OrderBlocksDifferenceDirectionOffset`, `SignalTradeQuantityPerOrderBlock`, `SignalTradeSplitBars`

---

### gbPANAKanal — PANA Kanal

A **Keltner-style adaptive channel** that defines trend direction and generates pullback / breakout trade signals.

**How it works:**

1. **Channel Calculation** — uses a Wilder-style ATR multiplied by a configurable `Factor` to build dynamic upper and lower bands around the close. Once the close crosses a band, the band locks in place (ratchet behaviour) and only moves in the trend direction.
2. **Middle Band** — a double-smoothed EMA (EMA of EMA) over a configurable `MiddlePeriod` acts as a Keltner centre line used for Keltner-state transitions.
3. **Trend Direction** — the indicator is in *uptrend* when close is above the lower channel band; in *downtrend* when below the upper band. Direction flips are the Trend Start signal.
4. **Fibonacci Pullback Zones** — at each trend flip the indicator calculates the range from the trend extremum to the trailing stop and places Fibonacci levels at 61.8 % and 78.6 % retracement as pullback target zones.
5. **Signals:**
   - **Trend Start** — candle that crosses and closes past the channel band (trend reversal).
   - **Trend Pullback** — inside the pullback-finding period, a reversal candle (prior candle opposite direction, current candle trend direction) that wicks into the 61.8 % Fibonacci zone.
   - **Break** — price crosses the Keltner middle band in the trend direction after a pullback reset, confirming trend continuation.
6. **Bar Painting & Region Fill** — bars are coloured by trend direction; two gradient fill regions are drawn between the Fibonacci levels and the trailing stop.

**Output plots:** `Extremum`, `Middle`, `TrailingStop`, `Signal_Trend`, `Signal_Trade`

**Key parameters:** `Period`, `Factor`, `MiddlePeriod`, `SignalBreakSplit`, `SignalPullbackFindingPeriod`

---

### gbThunderZilla — ThunderZilla

A **dual-system trend + pullback indicator** that combines a SolarWind trailing stop with a Sumo multi-MA pullback detector and a multi-oscillator overbought/oversold slowdown filter.

**How it works:**

1. **SolarWind (SW) System** — computes a trailing stop offset by `StopOffsetMultiplierStop × TickSize`. The trend flips when close crosses the trailing stop. A secondary "trend vector" line (30 ticks above/below close) tracks the swing's momentum direction. Both SW trend direction and stop level are tracked independently.
2. **Sumo Pullback System** — aligns four moving averages: the configurable Trend MA (default SMA 100) plus EMA 14, EMA 30, and EMA 45. When all four are stacked (max = Trend MA in uptrend, min = Trend MA in downtrend) and a two-candle reversal pattern occurs (prior candle opposite, current candle trend direction) with price entirely inside the MA stack, a Sumo pullback signal fires. A spacing system (first signal at 15 bars, second at 30 bars) limits signal frequency.
3. **Combined Trend State** — the indicator is in *uptrend* only when both SW and Sumo agree; *downtrend* when both point down; *neutral* when they disagree. Transitions emit Trend Start signals.
4. **Multi-Oscillator OBOS Slowdown** — MFI (14), RSI (14 / smooth 3), and Stochastics (14/7/3) are evaluated simultaneously. When all three are overbought (> 70) simultaneously the indicator flags a *Slowdown*; when all three are oversold (< 30) it flags the reverse. The signal fires on the exit bar from the overlap zone within a 3-bar window.
5. **Move Stop Signal** — fires when the trailing stop crosses above the Trend MA in uptrend (or below in downtrend), signalling that the stop has been upgraded to a profit-protecting level.
6. **Cloud Rendering** — a shaded cloud is drawn between the Trend MA and the bar's body extremum, coloured by trend state.

**Output plots:** `Trend`, `Stop`, `Signal_Trend`, `Signal_Trade`

**Key parameters:** `TrendMAType`, `TrendPeriod`, `TrendSmoothingEnabled`, `TrendSmoothingMethod`, `TrendSmoothingPeriod`, `StopOffsetMultiplierStop`, `SignalQuantityPerFlat`, `SignalQuantityPerTrend`

### gbBarStatus — Bar Status

A **bar-completion progress indicator** that shows how far through the current bar you are, and optionally draws boundary lines for price-based chart types.

**How it works:**

1. **Time/Tick/Volume Charts** — on Second, Minute, Tick, and Volume charts the indicator tracks elapsed vs. total bar units and renders a horizontal progress bar with optional count-up / count-down text.
   - *Seconds / Minutes* — a DispatcherTimer fires every 500 ms, computing remaining time from `Bars.GetTime(CurrentBar)` versus the platform clock.
   - *Ticks* — `Bars.TickCount` is compared against the bar's tick period.
   - *Volume* — current bar volume is compared against the period volume.
2. **Price-Based Charts (Renko / Range / ninZaRenko / KingRenko)** — instead of a progress bar the indicator calculates and plots the upper and lower price bounds at which the current bar would close, accounting for a configurable tick offset and the asymmetric brick sizes of KingRenko.
3. **Gradient Colouring** — the progress bar cycles through five configurable gradient stops (0 %, 25 %, 50 %, 75 %, 100 % complete) to give an at-a-glance sense of urgency.
4. **Interactive Click** — clicking within the progress bar area cycles through three display modes (bar + text → bar only → text only). Clicking the count-mode symbol toggles between count-up and count-down.

**Output plots:** `UpperBound`, `LowerBound`

**Key parameters:** `BoundOffset`

---

### gbSuperJumpBoost — Super JumpBoost

An **ATR-derived multi-level zone indicator** that builds supply/demand zones from four configurable trend vectors and tracks price interaction with each zone through its full lifecycle (active → returned → broken).

**How it works:**

1. **Trend Vectors** — four independent `JumpBoostInfo` instances each run a trend-flip algorithm using ATR-scaled offsets (`OffsetLevel1`–`OffsetLevel4` relative to `OffsetBase`). Each vector tracks its own uptrend/downtrend state, a trailing stop level, and a slowdown counter that delays weak-trend transitions (`SensitiveModeEnabled` increases sensitivity by widening slowdown and split windows). A fifth master vector (using `TrendMultiplierStop`) drives the bar-painting stop check.
2. **Zone Formation** — when two or more adjacent trend vectors agree on direction, their price levels (trend line values) are sorted and assembled into a `ZoneInfo` with up to four lines: `TopPrice`, `PriceLevel1`, `PriceLevel2`, `BottomPrice`. Zones are only accepted if price is on the correct side of the zone's key level at formation time.
3. **Zone Lifecycle** — zones cycle through three lists:
   - **Active** — zone is untested; price is still on the entry side.
   - **Inactive** — zone has returned at least one signal; price broke through the key level after a return.
   - **Broken** — zone was never traded and price closed through the key level.
4. **Signals** — two signal types per zone:
   - **Return** — a confirming close on the correct side of the zone's inner level, following a wick through it, within the max `SignalQuantityPerZone` limit and `SignalSplit` bar spacing.
   - **Zone Start** — fires immediately when a new zone is accepted.
5. **Extremum Tracking** — independently tracks swing highs/lows using a configurable `ExtremeNeighborhood`. Levels migrate from *naked* (untested) to *tested* (closed through) lists and render as distinct horizontal lines.
6. **Rendering** — active and inactive zones draw up to four parallel horizontal lines per zone, each with its own `Stroke` (weight, colour, opacity). Broken zones use a separate neutral stroke. Price labels and bar/background highlighting complete the visual.

**Output plots:** `Signal_State` (±1 = Bullish/Bearish bias), `Signal_Trade` (±1 = Return signal, ±2 = Zone Start), `Signal_Zone` (±1 = current zone direction)

**Key parameters:** `SensitiveModeEnabled`, `OffsetLevel1`–`OffsetLevel4`, `OffsetBase`, `ReferencePricePeriod`, `LineLevelsOffset`, `ExtremeNeighborhood`, `SignalCloseThreshold`, `SignalQuantityPerZone`, `SignalSplit`

---

### gbSumoPullback — Sumo Pullback

A **multi-MA cloud pullback indicator** that signals when a two-candle reversal pattern fires entirely inside a stacked moving average cloud.

**How it works:**

1. **MA Cloud** — one slow MA (default SMA 60) and three fast MAs (default EMA 14 / EMA 30 / EMA 45) are computed each bar. The cloud maximum and minimum are the highest and lowest values across all four. Two `Draw.Region` fills shade the space between the slow MA and the cloud's max/min, coloured by trend direction.
2. **Trend Alignment Check** — the slow MA must be the *minimum* of all four MAs to confirm an uptrend stack (fast MAs fanned above it), or the *maximum* to confirm a downtrend stack. This ensures the cloud is properly sorted before a pullback can signal.
3. **Candle Pattern** — a valid signal requires the full price bar to sit *inside* the cloud (`min > Low` and `max < High`) and a two-bar reversal: prior candle opposite-direction, current candle trend-direction.
4. **Signal Spacing** — the first occurrence resets a bar counter; a second signal can only fire after `SignalSplitFirst` bars; subsequent signals require `SignalSplitSecond` bars. The counter resets when either limit elapses without a second signal.
5. **Fair Value Plot** — the arithmetic mean of all four MAs is plotted as a gold square line, giving a single reference price for the cloud midpoint.

**Output plots:** `FairValue` (mean of all four MAs), `Signal_Trade` (±1)

**Key parameters:** `SlowMAType`, `SlowMAPeriod`, `FastMA1Type`/`FastMA1Period`, `FastMA2Type`/`FastMA2Period`, `FastMA3Type`/`FastMA3Period`, `SignalSplitFirst`, `SignalSplitSecond`

> **Note:** The `SlowMASmoothingEnabled` / `FastMA*SmoothingEnabled` properties are present in the parameter panel but the smoothing pass is not yet implemented — the raw MA value is always used.

### NewsSignals — Economic Calendar News Filter

**Namespace:** `NinjaTrader.NinjaScript.Indicators.Playr101`

A **standalone news-awareness indicator** by Playr101 that fetches the ForexFactory economic calendar, renders upcoming events on the chart, and exposes blocking state via `Series<double>` plots so other scripts can suppress trading around news releases.

**How it works:**

1. **Data fetch** — on a configurable refresh interval (default 15 min), the indicator fetches `http://nfs.faireconomy.media/ff_calendar_thisweek.xml` with a 5-second timeout and parses the week's events into a `NewsEvent[]` array.
2. **Filtering** — events can be filtered to USD-only, today-only, and by impact level (High / Medium / Low). Low-priority events can be hidden from the display while still contributing to the block window.
3. **Block window calculation** — for each qualifying event, a pre-news window and post-news window are computed relative to `DateTime.Now` (realtime) or `Time[0]` (historical). When any event's window overlaps the current time, `IsNewsBlockActive` is `true`.
4. **Chart rendering** — a three-column table (Time / Impact / Description) is drawn via SharpDX DirectWrite at a configurable corner of the chart panel. Events inside the alert window are highlighted in bold italic with a configurable warning colour.
5. **Alerts** — when a news event enters the alert window (`AlertInterval` minutes before), an NT8 alert is fired once per event (keyed by date + country + title to prevent repeats).

**Public plots (readable by strategies):**

| Plot | Content |
|---|---|
| `NewsBlock` | 1.0 if currently inside a pre/post block window, else 0.0 |
| `MinutesToNextNews` | Minutes until next qualifying event; −1 if none |
| `NextImpactScore` | Impact of the next event: 3=High, 2=Medium, 1=Low |
| `MinutesFromRecentNews` | Minutes since last qualifying event; −1 if none |

**Public accessors:** `IsNewsBlockActive` (bool), `NextNewsTitle` (string), `NextNewsTime` (DateTime)

**Key parameters:**

| Group | Parameter | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Display | `ShowNewsDisplay` | `true` |
| Display | `DisplayLocation` | `TopRight` |
| Display | `Use24timeFormat` | `false` |
| Display | `ShowBackground` | `false` |
| News Filter | `USOnlyEvents` | `true` |
| News Filter | `TodaysNewsOnly` | `true` |
| News Filter | `ShowLowPriority` | `false` |
| News Filter | `MaxNewsItems` | 10 |
| News Filter | `NewsRefeshInterval` | 15 min |
| Strategy Blocking | `PreNewsBlockMinutes` / `PostNewsBlockMinutes` | 5 / 5 |
| Strategy Blocking | `BlockHighImpact` / `BlockMediumImpact` / `BlockLowImpact` | `true` / `true` / `false` |
| Alerts | `SendAlerts` / `AlertInterval` | `true` / 15 min |
| Debug | `Debug` | `false` |

> **Note:** `NewsSignals` is a live-chart-only indicator. It requires a chart context and an active internet connection. It does not run in Strategy Analyzer, backtest, or Market Replay — the strategy detects this and disables the news filter automatically in those contexts.

## Strategy

### gbKingPanaZillaKillah — ATM Strategy by Playr101

An **ATM-mode strategy** (v1.5.6) that drives NinjaTrader 8's native ATM Strategy engine from the three `gbKingPanaZilla` signals. Selecting any combination of the three signal outputs (PZ, KZ, KP) is controlled via per-signal toggles. Risk is managed by a daily profit target and daily loss limit evaluated tick-by-tick against both realized and (optionally) open equity.

**How it works:**

1. **Signal evaluation** — on each primary bar, `PanaZilla_Trade`, `KingZilla_Trade`, and `KingPana_Trade` are read from `gbKingPanaZilla`. Any enabled signal at +1 triggers a long entry; at −1 a short entry.
2. **EMA filter** — when enabled, long entries require price above the EMA and short entries require price below it. Signals in the wrong direction relative to the EMA are suppressed.
3. **News filter** — when enabled, entries are blocked during a configurable pre/post window around qualifying news events, sourced from the `NewsSignals` indicator. Optionally, open positions are flattened when a warning window begins.
4. **ATM order submission** — entries are placed via `AtmStrategyCreate` with a user-selected ATM template. Only one ATM position is open at a time; new signals are ignored while a position is active.
5. **Session filters** — two independent time windows (TF1, TF2) restrict trading hours. Each window can optionally flatten all positions at its close.
6. **Risk management** — realized and unrealized PnL are tracked every tick. When the daily profit target or daily loss limit is breached, all positions are flattened and new entries are blocked for the session.
7. **Naked-position watchdog** — every 3 seconds in realtime the strategy confirms that any open position has an active ATM with working protective orders. If a naked position is detected (e.g. ATM dropped), it is immediately flattened.
8. **Button panel** — an on-chart WPF control panel provides live arm-long / arm-short / auto-arm / close buttons and a status label for manual override without stopping the strategy.

**Key parameters:**

| Group | Parameter | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Signals | `EnableSignalTracking` | `false` |
| Signals | `UsePanaZillaSignals`, `UseKingZillaSignals`, `UseKingPanaSignals` | all `true` |
| ATM | `AtmStrategy` | *(select from installed ATM templates)* |
| EMA Filter | `UseEmaFilter` / `EmaFilterPeriod` | `false` / 50 |
| News Filter | `EnableNewsFilter` | `false` |
| News Filter | `NewsFlattenAtWarningTime` | `false` |
| News Filter | `NewsPreBlockMinutes` / `NewsPostBlockMinutes` | 5 / 5 |
| News Filter | `NewsBlockHighImpact` / `NewsBlockMediumImpact` / `NewsBlockLowImpact` | `true` / `true` / `false` |
| Risk | `UseDailyProfitTarget` / `DailyProfitTarget` | `false` / $500 |
| Risk | `UseDailyLossLimit` / `DailyLossLimit` | `true` / $200 |
| Risk | `UseUnrealizedPnl` | `true` |
| Session | `EnableTF1` / `StartTime1`–`EndTime1` / `FlattenTF1` | `true` / 09:30–12:00 / `true` |
| Session | `EnableTF2` / `StartTime2`–`EndTime2` / `FlattenTF2` | `true` / 13:00–15:30 / `true` |
| Logging | `LogEnabled` | `false` |
| Logging | `EnableDebug` | `false` |

**Signal Tracking Display (`EnableSignalTracking`):**

When enabled, the on-chart PnL panel (bottom-right) expands to show a running trade breakdown by signal source. After each trade closes, the last result appears as a summary line followed by per-signal counters:

```
--- gbKingPanaZillaKillah v1.5.1 ---

### GodZillaKilla — Direct-Signal ATM Strategy by Playr101

An **ATM-mode strategy** (v1.4.1) that reads all five suite indicators directly — `gbKingOrderBlock`, `gbPANAKanal`, `gbThunderZilla`, `gbSuperJumpBoost`, and `gbSumoPullback` — without the `gbKingPanaZilla` intermediary. Two independently-configurable signal **Sets** define which indicators must agree and at what threshold before an entry is submitted.

**How it works:**

1. **Signal Sets** — Set 1 is always active. Set 2 is an optional second configuration that can fire a group-trigger (all-or-nothing) entry independently. Each Set specifies a **Required Count** (minimum number of enabled indicators that must signal), individual per-indicator **Use** toggles, and separate **Long Value** / **Short Value** thresholds:

   | Indicator | Long signal | Short signal |
   |---|---|---|
   | `gbKingOrderBlock` | `Signal_Trade ≥` threshold (1=Return, 2=Breakout) | `Signal_Trade ≤` threshold |
   | `gbPANAKanal` | `Signal_Trade ≥` threshold (1=Trend Start, 2=Break, 3=Pullback) | `Signal_Trade ≤` threshold |
   | `gbThunderZilla` | `Signal_Trade ≥` threshold (1=Trend Start, 2=Slowdown, 3=Pullback, 4=Move Stop) | `Signal_Trade ≤` threshold |
   | `gbSuperJumpBoost` | `Signal_Trade ≥` threshold (1=Return, 2=Zone Start) | `Signal_Trade ≤` threshold |
   | `gbSumoPullback` | `Signal_Trade ≥` threshold (1=Pullback) | `Signal_Trade ≤` threshold |

   The trigger label written to the trade log encodes which indicators fired and the Set that triggered (e.g. `SET1-G3:PA+TH+SJ`).

2. **EMA filter** — when enabled, longs require the short EMA to be above the long EMA; shorts require it below. Configurable short and long EMA periods.

3. **Order modes** — `AtmStrategy` (recommended): entries placed via `AtmStrategyCreate` using a selected NT8 ATM template; only one position open at a time. `FixedTicks`: strategy-managed market entries with fixed stop-loss ticks, profit-target ticks, and an optional breakeven move.

4. **Martingale recovery** — when enabled, a stop-loss on a normal trade immediately submits one opposite-direction recovery entry using a separate `MartingaleAtmStrategy` template. A losing martingale does not trigger another martingale.

5. **News filter** — same `NewsSignals`-based pre/post blocking as gbKingPanaZillaKillah. Disabled automatically during Strategy Analyzer, backtest, and Market Replay.

6. **Risk management** — daily profit target and daily loss limit checked tick-by-tick against realized + (optionally) unrealized PnL. Breach flattens all positions and blocks new entries for the session.

7. **Session filters** — three independent time windows (TF1, TF2, TF3), each with optional flatten-at-close. A configurable **Skip Window** can suppress trading within a recurring intra-session block (e.g. the open auction).

8. **Naked-position watchdog** — wall-clock throttled (runs in realtime only). Detects positions that have no active ATM or working protective orders and immediately flattens them.

9. **Signal tracking** — when enabled, per-indicator win/loss counters are displayed in the dashboard HUD after each trade closes, broken out by which indicators contributed to the trigger.

10. **ATM trade markers** — draws a coloured entry-to-exit line on the price panel for each completed ATM trade. The exit text label (entry price, exit price) appears only after the trade closes, not during the open trade.

11. **Button panel** — on-chart WPF panel with arm-long / arm-short / auto-arm / close-all buttons and a live status label.

**CSV Trade Log:**

Same format as `gbKingPanaZillaKillah`, written to the NinjaTrader user data folder:

```
GodZillaKilla_YYYYMMDD_HHmmss.csv
```

```
OpenTime,Account,Instrument,OpenPrice,Qty,CloseTime,Trigger,Direction,AtmStrategy,RealizedPnL

```

The trigger field encodes the Set name, group size (number of indicators that fired), and the abbreviated indicator names (`KO`=KingOrderBlock, `PA`=PANAKanal, `TH`=ThunderZilla, `SJ`=SuperJumpBoost, `SU`=SumoPullback).

```

Each indicator is its own file. `gbKingPanaZilla` references the three child indicators and must be compiled after them. `gbSuperJumpBoost` and `gbSumoPullback` are fully standalone. `NewsSignals` is standalone. `gbKingPanaZillaKillah` references both the `gbKingPanaZilla` and `NewsSignals` namespaces. `GodZillaKilla` references all five suite indicators and `NewsSignals` directly — both strategy files must be compiled last.

## Installation

Copy the indicator and strategy files into their respective NinjaTrader 8 custom folders:

```
Documents\NinjaTrader 8\bin\Custom\Indicators\   ← gbKingOrderBlock.cs, gbPANAKanal.cs,
                                                      gbThunderZilla.cs, gbKingPanaZilla.cs,
                                                      gbBarStatus.cs, gbSuperJumpBoost.cs,
                                                      gbSumoPullback.cs, NewsSignals.cs
Documents\NinjaTrader 8\bin\Custom\Strategies\   ← gbKingPanaZillaKillah.cs, GodZillaKilla.cs
```

Then compile via **NinjaTrader → Tools → Edit NinjaScript → Compile**.

Compile order matters: the three child indicators (`gbKingOrderBlock`, `gbPANAKanal`, `gbThunderZilla`) must compile before `gbKingPanaZilla`. `gbSuperJumpBoost`, `gbSumoPullback`, and `NewsSignals` are standalone and can compile in any order. Both strategy files (`gbKingPanaZillaKillah`, `GodZillaKilla`) must compile after all indicators.
